          depvar is the dependent variable
      
          tvar must contain values 0 or 1, representing the treatment (1) and comparison (0) groups.
      
          pvar must contain values 0 or 1, representing the pre-intervention (0) and post-intervention (1) periods.
      
          varlist is a (optional) list of covariates variables (see the remarks)

          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            options.
      
      
          bsopts                     Description
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          reps(#)                     perform # bootstrap replications; default is 1000
          saving(filename[,replace])  save bootstrap results to filename (optionally, replace specifies that filename be
                                       overwritten, if it exists.)
          sepercentile                obtain bootstrap standard errors from percentiles of bootstrap estimates instead of
                                       using Stata's default method. standard error = (p(97.5) - p(2.5)) / (2*1.96), where
                                       p(N) is Nth percentile of bootstrap iterations (this is the method used in Athey and
                                       Imbens' MATLAB code)
          accel(vector)               acceleration values for each statistic
          mse                         use MSE formula for variance estimation
          nodots                      suppress the replication dots
          size(#)                     draw samples of size #
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          vce(bootstrap[, bsopts]) stratifies the sample by tvar and pvar
          See bootstrap postestimation for features available after estimation.
          The following two lines are equivalent:
              . cic y treat post, vce(bootstrap, [bsopts])
              . bootstrap _b, strata(treat post) [bsopts]: cic y treat post, vce(none)
          However, the second line is slower because vce(bootstrap) is implemented in Mata and runs with less overhead.
              However, the bootstrap prefix is more flexible due the availability of size(), strata(), cluster(), idcluster()
              and other options.
          CIC also appears to works with the svy bootstrap: prefix, but you will need to use svyset to set up the
            bsrweight() variables, PSUs, weights and strata before calling CIC.
          The sample size for size(#) is defined as follows:  without weights, the sample in each group is calculated as the
            number of observations in the group; with fweights, the sample in each group is calculated as the sum of the
            fweights for observations in the group; with iweights, the sample in each group is calculated as the sum of the
            iweights for observations in the group, divided by the sum of the weights for all observations, and multiplied
            by the value specified in size() (rounded to the nearest integer -- by default, size()==the sum of the
            iweights); with aweights, the weights are normalized to mean 1. then, the sample in each group is calculated as
            the sum of the weights for observations in the group (rounded to the nearest integer).  This sub-option is
            allowed only with pweights, aweights, and iweights. With unweighted samples, you could generate a variable equal
            to one and use it as an iweight.
      
      
      Description
      
          This Stata command, cic, implements the changes-in-changes (CIC) model proposed by Athey and Imbens (2006).  The
          command estimates the average and quantile treatment effects of a treatment in settings where repeated cross
          sections of individuals are observed in a treatment group and a control group, before and after the treatment.
          The CIC model relaxes several assumptions of the standard linear difference-in-differences model.  Both the
          continuous CIC model and discrete CIC model (with and without a conditional independence assumption) are included
          in the cic command, as are treatment effects from standard linear difference-in-differences model and a quantile
          difference-in-differences model.  By implementing the CIC estimator alongside these other two pre-existing
          estimators, the cic command can illustrate how the effect the treatment varies across a variety of assumptions.
      
      
      Remarks
      
          I wrote the code for this Stata implementation for one of my dissertation projects (Kranker 2011, 2016).  The code
          started as a simple "port" of Athey and Imbens' Matlab code.  Then I made some changes to the code to speed it up
          in various ways and extend the methods.
      
          While was rummaging through some old files in June 2019, I ran across this code, thought it might be helpful to
          others, and decided to post the package online.  I see Blaise Melley also has his own version of the model for
          Stata.  Let's hope this release prevents yet another person from doing this work!
      
          The use of difference-in-differences (DID) methods is widespread in program evaluation and empirical economics
          (Imbens and Wooldridge 2009). DID methods involve comparing outcomes between two groups across two time periods,
          where only one of the two groups are exposed to the intervention in one of the periods.  The DID estimator
          calculates the difference in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups after the intervention began,
          minus the difference in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups before the intervention began.  Or,
          equivalently, the DID estimator can be seen as the change in outcomes for the treatment group before and after the
          intervention, minus the change in outcomes for the comparison group over the same time period.  It is
          straightforward to generalize this basic two group, two period DID model has been generalized in various waysâ€”for
          example, to adjust for observed covariates, include more than two groups, or include more than two time periods.
      
          Athey and Imbens (2006) proposed a changes-in-changes (CIC) model which generalizes the DID model by relaxing
          relaxes several assumptions.  (Thus the standard DID model is nested in the CIC model as a special case.) The CIC
          model estimates the entire distribution of outcomes under the counterfactual, allowing one to calculate average
          treatment effects or estimate effects at specific quantiles.
      
          This Stata command, cic, implements the CIC estimator from Athey and Imbens (2006).  cic is written in Mata with
          an effort to maximize parallel computing; in tests (not shown), I found cic estimated the model more quickly than
          the Matlab code previously distributed by Athey and Imbens.  The cic command also offers several previously
          unavailable features (e.g., to allow for covariates).  In addition, you can use Stata's bootstrap: prefix, which
          offers more flexibility for computing bootstrapped standard errors (e.g., strata, blocks).
      
          Imbens and Wooldridge (2009) provide a nice, short overview of the method.  Athey and Imbens (2006) explain their
          methods (with proofs) in a fairly long and complicated article.  The appendix is also quite helpful.
      
          Covaraiates are implemented according to the parametric approach outlined by Athey and Imbens (2006):  "... apply
          the CIC estimator to the residuals from an ordinary least squares regression with the effects of the dummy
          variables added back in." (p. 466)
